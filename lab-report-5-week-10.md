# LAB REPORT 5

Let's talk about the final lab report.

For my tests, I picked test [14.md](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/14.md) and [41.md](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/41.md).
Both these tests resulted in different outputs between my implementation and the 'official' implementation.

I picked these tests by outputting the result of my implemenation and the official MarkdownParse to the console, as well as the filename being compared (via shell script).
For efficiency, I only outputted a result if there was a link found.
